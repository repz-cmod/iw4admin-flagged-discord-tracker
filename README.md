# iw4admin-flagged-discord-tracker
IW4Admin Plugin: Tracks flagged users and sends message to discord 

According to [Plugin Wiki in IW4Admin](https://github.com/RaidMax/IW4M-Admin/wiki/Plugins) it's enough to just put the js file under plugins directory. 

Therefore, use `flagged-discord-tracker.js` file as js plugin and make sure you change `webhookUrl` to your own discord webhook url.
